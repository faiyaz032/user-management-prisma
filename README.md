# User Management System

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Node.js (v14 or later)

I've used a free cluster of PostGreSQL on render. For portability. Thats why response maybe slow.

I am also pushing the env file so that tester can easily run the code.
